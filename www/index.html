                    <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <p>
                        The JOGL project hosts the development version of the
                        Java&trade; Binding for the OpenGL&reg; API (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=231">JSR-231</a>),
                        and is designed to provide hardware-supported 3D graphics to applications written in Java.
                        JOGL provides full access to the
                        <a href="../doc/bouml/html-svg/">APIs in the OpenGL 1.3 - 3.0, &ge; 3.1, ES 1.x and ES 2.x specification</a>
                        as well as nearly all vendor extensions.
                        It integrates with the AWT and Swing widget sets, as well with custom windowing toolkits using the the NativeWindow API.
                        It is part of a suite of open-source technologies initiated by the Game Technology Group at Sun Microsystems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please see the <a href="http://jogamp.org/jogl-demos/www">JOGL demos</a> for illustrations of
                        advanced OpenGL techniques now possible with the Java platform.
