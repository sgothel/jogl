<!-- This file is the one canonical location containing the version
     numbers for the various components such as JOGL and Newt. -->

<project name="versions">

  <!-- This is the base version of JOGL. For official release builds,
       and nightly builds, this should be in the form "x.y{.z}", for
       example, "2.0" or "2.1.1". Nightly builds will have a "-pre-"
       and a timestamp automatically added to this version number. For
       intermediate release builds, this should be in the form, for
       example, "2.0-beta1" or "2.0-rc1". For large releases, push
       betas before release candidates to give the Community time to
       react.-->

  <!-- Uncomment this property in order to produce a JOGL release
       build without running the "RI" (Reference Implementation)

       official release builds and intermediate release builds, but
       commented out for nightly builds. -->

  <!-- Base version of the Newt library, following the same
       rules as above -->
  <property name="newt_base_version" value="2.0" />

  <!-- Newt isn't covered by a JSR at the moment, so there is little
       value in having a different reference implementation
       vs. intermediate build numbering scheme, but for the moment
       let's keep things symmetric. This should be uncommented for
       official release builds and intermediate release builds, but
       commented out for nightly builds.  -->
