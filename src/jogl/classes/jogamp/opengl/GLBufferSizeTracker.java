/**
 * Tracks as closely as possible the sizes of allocated OpenGL buffer
 * objects. When glMapBuffer or glMapBufferARB is called, in order to
 * turn the resulting base address into a java.nio.ByteBuffer, we need
 * to know the size in bytes of the allocated OpenGL buffer object.
 * Previously we would compute this size by using
 * glGetBufferParameterivARB with a pname of GL_BUFFER_SIZE, but
 * it appears doing so each time glMapBuffer is called is too costly
 * on at least Apple's new multithreaded OpenGL implementation. <P>
 *
 * Instead we now try to track the sizes of allocated buffer objects.
 * We watch calls to glBindBuffer to see which buffer is bound to
 * which target and to glBufferData to see how large the buffer's
 * allocated size is. When glMapBuffer is called, we consult our table
 * of buffer sizes to see if we can return an answer without a glGet
 * call. <P>
 *
 * We share the GLBufferSizeTracker objects among all GLContexts for
 * which sharing is enabled, because the namespace for buffer objects
 * is the same for these contexts. <P>
 *
 * Tracking the state of which buffer objects are bound is done in the
 * GLBufferStateTracker and is not completely trivial. In the face of
 * calls to glPushClientAttrib / glPopClientAttrib we currently punt
 * and re-fetch the bound buffer object for the state in question;
 * see, for example, glVertexPointer and the calls down to
 * GLBufferStateTracker.getBoundBufferObject(). Note that we currently
 * ignore new binding targets such as GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER_NV;
 * the fact that new binding targets may be added in the future makes
 * it impossible to cache state for these new targets. <P>
 *
 * Ignoring new binding targets, the primary situation in which we may
 * not be able to return a cached answer is in the case of an error,
 * where glBindBuffer may not have been called before trying to call
 * glBufferData. Also, if external native code modifies a buffer
 * object, we may return an incorrect answer. (FIXME: this case
 * requires more thought, and perhaps stochastic and
 * exponential-fallback checking. However, note that it can only occur
 * in the face of external native code which requires that the
 * application be signed anyway, so there is no security risk in this
 * area.)
