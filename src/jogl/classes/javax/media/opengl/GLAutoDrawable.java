/** A higher-level abstraction than {@link GLDrawable} which supplies
    an event based mechanism ({@link GLEventListener}) for performing
    OpenGL rendering. A GLAutoDrawable automatically creates a primary
    rendering context which is associated with the GLAutoDrawable for
    the lifetime of the object. This context has the {@link
    GLContext#setSynchronized synchronized} property enabled so that
    calls to {@link GLContext#makeCurrent makeCurrent} will block if
    the context is current on another thread. This allows the internal
    GLContext for the GLAutoDrawable to be used both by the event
    based rendering mechanism as well by end users directly.<P>

    The implementation shall initialize itself as soon as possible,
    ie if the attached {@link javax.media.nativewindow.NativeWindow NativeWindow} is become visible. 
    The following protocol shall be satisfied:
    <ul>
        <li> Create the  {@link GLDrawable} with the requested {@link GLCapabilities}</li>
        <li> Notify {@link GLDrawable} to validate the {@link GLCapabilities} by calling {@link GLDrawable#setRealized setRealized(true)}.</li>
        <li> Create the new {@link GLContext}.</li>
        <li> Initialize all OpenGL resources by calling {@link GLEventListener#init init(..)} for all
             registered {@link GLEventListener}s. This can be done immediatly, or with the followup {@link #display display(..)} call.</li>
        <li> Send a reshape event by calling {@link GLEventListener#reshape reshape(..)} for all
             registered {@link GLEventListener}s. This shall be done after the {@link GLEventListener#init init(..)} calls.</li>
    </ul><P>

    Another implementation detail is the drawable reconfiguration. One use case is where a window is being 
    dragged to another screen with a different pixel configuration, ie {@link GLCapabilities}. The implementation 
    shall be able to detect such cases in conjunction with the associated {@link javax.media.nativewindow.NativeWindow NativeWindow}.<br>
    For example, AWT's {@link java.awt.Canvas} 's {@link java.awt.Canvas#getGraphicsConfiguration getGraphicsConfiguration()}
    is capable to determine a display device change. This is demonstrated within {@link javax.media.opengl.awt.GLCanvas}'s 
    and NEWT's <code>AWTCanvas</code> {@link javax.media.opengl.awt.GLCanvas#getGraphicsConfiguration getGraphicsConfiguration()} 
    specialization. Another demonstration is NEWT's {@link javax.media.nativewindow.NativeWindow NativeWindow} 
    implementation on the the Windows platform, which utilizes the native platform's <i>MonitorFromWindow(HWND)</i> function.<br>
    All OpenGL resources shall be regenerated, while the drawable's {@link GLCapabilities} has 
    to be choosen again. The following protocol shall be satisfied.
    <ul>
        <li> Controlled disposal:</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Dispose all OpenGL resources by calling {@link GLEventListener#dispose dispose(..)} for all
                 registered {@link GLEventListener}s.</li>
            <li> Destroy the {@link GLContext}.</li>
            <li> Notify {@link GLDrawable} of the invalid state by calling {@link GLDrawable#setRealized setRealized(false)}.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> Controlled regeneration:</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Create the new {@link GLDrawable} with the requested {@link GLCapabilities}
            <li> Notify {@link GLDrawable} to revalidate the {@link GLCapabilities} by calling {@link GLDrawable#setRealized setRealized(true)}.</li>
            <li> Create the new {@link GLContext}.</li>
            <li> Initialize all OpenGL resources by calling {@link GLEventListener#init init(..)} for all
                 registered {@link GLEventListener}s. This can be done immediatly, or with the followup {@link #display display(..)} call.</li>
            <li> Send a reshape event by calling {@link GLEventListener#reshape reshape(..)} for all
                 registered {@link GLEventListener}s. This shall be done after the {@link GLEventListener#init init(..)} calls.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    Note: Current graphics driver keep the surface configuration for a given window, even if the window is moved to 
    a monitor with a different pixel configuration, ie 32bpp to 16bpp. However, it is best to not assume such behavior
    and make your application comply with the above protocol.<P>

    However, to not introduce to much breakage with older applications and because of the situation 
    mentioned above, the <code>boolean</code> system property <code>jogl.screenchange.action</code> will control the 
    screen change action as follows:<br>

    <PRE>
    -Djogl.screenchange.action=false Disable the drawable reconfiguration (the default)
    -Djogl.screenchange.action=true  Enable  the drawable reconfiguration
    </PRE>
