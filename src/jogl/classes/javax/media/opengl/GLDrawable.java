   * <p>
   * If realized, the {@link #getHandle() drawable handle} may become
   * valid while it's {@link NativeSurface surface} is being {@link NativeSurface#lockSurface() locked}.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * End users do not need to call this method; it is not necessary to
   * call <code>setRealized</code> on a {@link GLAutoDrawable}
   * as these perform the appropriate calls on their underlying GLDrawables internally.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Developers implementing new OpenGL components for various window
   * toolkits need to call this method against GLDrawables obtained
   * from the GLDrawableFactory via the
   * {@link GLDrawableFactory#createGLDrawable(NativeSurface)} method.
   * It must typically be
   * called with an argument of <code>true</code> when the component
   * associated with the GLDrawable is realized and with an argument
   * of <code>false</code> just before the component is unrealized.
   * For the AWT, this means calling <code>setRealized(true)</code> in
   * the <code>addNotify</code> method and with an argument of
   * <code>false</code> in the <code>removeNotify</code> method.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * <code>GLDrawable</code> implementations should handle multiple
   * cycles of <code>setRealized(true)</code> /
   * <code>setRealized(false)</code> calls. Most, if not all, Java
   * window toolkits have a persistent object associated with a given
   * component, regardless of whether that component is currently
   * realized. The <CODE>GLDrawable</CODE> object associated with a
   * particular component is intended to be similarly persistent. A
   * <CODE>GLDrawable</CODE> is intended to be created for a given
   * component when it is constructed and live as long as that
   * component. <code>setRealized</code> allows the
   * <code>GLDrawable</code> to re-initialize and destroy any
   * associated resources as the component becomes realized and
   * unrealized, respectively.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * With an argument of <code>true</code>,
   * the minimum implementation shall call
   * {@link NativeSurface#lockSurface() NativeSurface's lockSurface()} and if successful:
   * <ul>
   *    <li> Update the {@link GLCapabilities}, which are associated with
   *         the attached {@link NativeSurface}'s {@link AbstractGraphicsConfiguration}.</li>
   *    <li> Release the lock with {@link NativeSurface#unlockSurface() NativeSurface's unlockSurface()}.</li>
   * </ul><br>
   * This is important since {@link NativeSurface#lockSurface() NativeSurface's lockSurface()}
   * ensures resolving the window/surface handles, and the drawable's {@link GLCapabilities}
   * might have changed.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Calling this method has no other effects. For example, if
   * <code>removeNotify</code> is called on a Canvas implementation
   * for which a GLDrawable has been created, it is also necessary to
   * destroy all OpenGL contexts associated with that GLDrawable. This
   * is not done automatically by the implementation.
