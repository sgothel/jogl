/**
 * Platform-independent {@link GLDrawable} specialization,
 * exposing {@link FBObject} functionality.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@link GLFBODrawable} is uninitialized until a {@link GLContext} is bound
 * and made current the first time, hence only then it's capabilities <i>fully</i> reflect expectations,
 * i.e. color, depth, stencil and MSAA bits will be <i>valid</i> only after the first {@link GLContext#makeCurrent() makeCurrent()} call.
 * On-/offscreen bits are <i>valid</i> after {@link #setRealized(boolean) setRealized(true)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * MSAA is used if {@link GLCapabilitiesImmutable#getNumSamples() requested}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Double buffering is used if {@link GLCapabilitiesImmutable#getDoubleBuffered() requested}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In MSAA mode, it always uses the implicit 2nd {@link FBObject framebuffer} {@link FBObject#getSamplingSinkFBO() sink}.
 * Hence double buffering is always the case w/ MSAA.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In non MSAA a second explicit {@link FBObject framebuffer} is being used.
 * This method allows compliance w/ the spec, i.e. read and draw framebuffer selection
 * and double buffer usage for e.g. {@link GL#glReadPixels(int, int, int, int, int, int, java.nio.Buffer) glReadPixels(..)}.
 * This method also allows usage of both textures seperately.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It would be possible to implement double buffering simply using
 * {@link TextureAttachment}s with one {@link FBObject framebuffer}.
 * This would require mode selection and hence complicate the API. Besides, it would
 * not support differentiation of read and write framebuffer and hence not be spec compliant.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Actual swapping of the {@link TextureAttachment texture}s and/or {@link FBObject framebuffer}
 * is performed either in the {@link jogamp.opengl.GLContextImpl#contextMadeCurrent(boolean) context current hook}
 * or when {@link jogamp.opengl.GLDrawableImpl#swapBuffersImpl(boolean) swapping buffers}, whatever comes first.
