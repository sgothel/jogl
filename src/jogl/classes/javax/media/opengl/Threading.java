/** This API provides access to the threading model for the implementation of
    the classes in this package.

    <P>

    OpenGL is specified as a thread-safe API, but in practice there
    are multithreading-related issues on most, if not all, of the
    platforms which support it. For example, some OpenGL
    implementations do not behave well when one context is made
    current first on one thread, released, and then made current on a
    second thread, although this is legal according to the OpenGL
    specification. On other platforms there are other problems.

    <P>

    Due to these limitations, and due to the inherent multithreading
    in the Java platform (in particular, in the Abstract Window
    Toolkit), it is often necessary to limit the multithreading
    occurring in the typical application using the OpenGL API.

    <P>

    In the current reference implementation, for instance, multithreading
    has been limited by
    forcing all OpenGL-related work for GLAutoDrawables on to a single
    thread. In other words, if an application uses only the
    GLAutoDrawable and GLEventListener callback mechanism, it is
    guaranteed to have the most correct single-threaded behavior on
    all platforms.

    <P>

    Applications using the GLContext makeCurrent/release API directly
    will inherently break this single-threaded model, as these methods
    require that the OpenGL context be made current on the current
    thread immediately. For applications wishing to integrate better
    with an implementation that uses the single-threaded model, this
    class provides public access to the mechanism used by the implementation.

    <P>

    Users can execute Runnables on the
    internal thread used for performing OpenGL work, and query whether
    the current thread is already this thread. Using these mechanisms
    the user can move work from the current thread on to the internal
    OpenGL thread if desired.

    <P>

    This class also provides mechanisms for querying whether this
    internal serialization of OpenGL work is in effect, and a
    programmatic way of disabling it.  In the current reference
    implementation it is enabled by default, although it could be
    disabled in the future if OpenGL drivers become more robust on
    all platforms.

    <P>

    In addition to specifying programmatically whether the single
    thread for OpenGL work is enabled, users may switch it on and off
    using the system property <code>jogl.1thread</code>. Valid values
    for this system property are:

    <PRE>
    -Djogl.1thread=false     Disable single-threading of OpenGL work, hence use multithreading.
    -Djogl.1thread=true      Enable single-threading of OpenGL work (default -- on a newly-created worker thread)
    -Djogl.1thread=auto      Select default single-threading behavior (currently on)
    -Djogl.1thread=awt       Enable single-threading of OpenGL work on AWT event dispatch thread (current default on all
                             platforms, and also the default behavior older releases)
    -Djogl.1thread=worker    Enable single-threading of OpenGL work on newly-created worker thread (not suitable for Mac
                             OS X or X11 platforms, and risky on Windows in applet environments)
    </PRE>
