Locking
=========

Interface AbstractGraphicsDevice: lock() / unlock()

    - Used to exclusively lock the device
    - Current implementations: 
        - X11GraphicsDevice: XLockDisplay/XUnlockDisplay

    - Shall only be used, where race conditions may happen with
      device toolkit calls in regards to windowing resources,
      ie create/destroy .. etc

    - We call XInitThreads ASAP and a global X11 lock 
      is not necessary.

    - To ensure XInitThreads can be issued at first,
      GLProfile.initSingleton() shall be called
      in the static initializer block of the main class.

      TODO: 
      However, we have to investigate how to incooperate this
      with Applet loading.
      If such call ain't possible, a workaround could be to not
      call XInitThreads() and utilize AWT locks.

Interface NativeWindow: lockSurface() / unlockSurface()

    - Used to exclusively lock the surface

    - Implementations: 

        - JAWTWindow:
            - Recursive Lock
            - JAWT SurfaceLock

        - NEWT Window:
            - Recursive Lock
            - May have platform specific surface lock, currently: None


GLContext/GLDrawable Locking:

    - MakeCurrent: NativeWindow:lockSurface()
    - Release: NativeWindow:unlockSurface()

    - Create/Destroy/Realize/Swap: 
        - NativeWindow:lockSurface()
            - CreateImpl/DestroyImpl/Realize/Swap
        - NativeWindow:unlockSurface()

    - The Window impl. class shall lock the window recursive lock
      for all modifying operations.
      This should be the same lock as surfaceHandle!


Summary:

    Locking is implemented in the platform agnostic code layer.

    Locks and Order:
        1: - NativeWindow Surface/Window Lock
            - Locked: 
                - [makeCurrent .. release]
                - create/destroy  

    GLContextImpl:
        - makeCurrent
            - Surface i       - out only in error

        - release
            - Surface o - makeCurrentImpl

        - create
            - Surface i/o

        - destroy
            - Surface i/o

        - copy
            - Surface i/o

        - setSwapIntervalImpl
            - Surface i/o


    GLDrawableImpl
        - setRealizedImpl
            - Surface i/o

        - swapBuffersImpl
            - [Surface i/o] - if not locked already

Complying with synchronization/memory-barriers
using explicit locking:

- NativeSurface's handle access

Current 'violations' of synchronization/memory-barriers
using explicit locking:

- Using 'volatile' to avoid locking for read-only access
  with rare write access

    - GLAutoDrawable's drawable reference

    - GLAutoDrawable's context reference
        Since 7f7a23dd0ddf106e6f0c69fc2a05ff92ac56200e

    - GLContext's contextHandle
        Since 7f7a23dd0ddf106e6f0c69fc2a05ff92ac56200e

    - GLDrawableImpl's realized
        Used for Pre-locking queries, whether drawable is realized

- Misc 'volatile' usage:
